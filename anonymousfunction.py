x=10
y=(lambda x: x**2)
print(y(x))
# The above code defines a variable x with the value 10 and then creates an anonymous function (lambda function) that takes one argument x and returns its square.
# The lambda function is then called with the argument x, and the result is printed.
# The output will be 100, which is the square of 10.
